These files are the original files included in the SD Card with the Jacbot 3D printer from Jack Atlas. I found them on my old drive !

Unfortunately, 2 files are too big to be imported : 

-the JacBot 3D Printer Overview video, but you can find it here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gONtMldtCN8
-the repetier host installation files, but you can find these here : https://www.repetier.com/download-now/ (with also new versions for windows and linux)

I hope these files will be useful !
